Hi!

I'm Maaz Syed Adeeb. ðŸ¤“ An enthusiastic developer who loves JavaScript and all things front-end, at the moment. I've been a professional software dev since 2015, but I've been in love with computers and programming since I was a kid. I learnt [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) in fourth grade and was fascinated by the patterns I could generate by using simple for loops. I've not stopped since then.

I love writing tests for the code I write and Test Driven Development (TDD) interests me a lot. I'm a sucker for build and code formatting setups. I attend a lot of hackathons and have won quite a few.

In my free time, I like to eat various cuisines and play/watch football (not American). Also, I love open source. I'm a beginner you can say, but I like to make contributions where possible.

This blog will contain things I learn in my day to day life and I want to write as often as possible, since I'm always learning something.

Hope to see you around! ðŸ‘»
