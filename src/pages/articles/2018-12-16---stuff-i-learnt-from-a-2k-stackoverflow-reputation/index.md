I've been a member of StackOverflow (SO in short) for just over 5 years, though I've used it from much before. I never thought of getting an account earlier because I thought what would I do with it. Almost any answer that I wanted was always available by some mysterious force and I used to believe that only some legendary people know answers to stuff and I won't be a match to anyone of them.

Turns out, I was wrong. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ I posted my [first answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39314388/2950032) on September 2016 (that's approximately 3 years after joining), and was surprised that 2 people actually thought it was useful!! What a feeling! Since then, I started looking for questions to answer and here are the things that I've learnt along the way.

## The rush gets the best out of you üèÉ

It's a very well known fact that when you're under pressure, you tend to perform better. That's precisely what happens when you find a new question to answer. You're rushing to answer it before anyone does (Initially I guess. I still get that kick). Finding the right references, correcting the code formatting, double checking grammar. Unknowingly, you're actually getting better at the topics that you answer and follow. That's what happened with me at least!

## Improves your bug bashing skills üêõ üî™

If you think from a different angle, a SO question is a bug or a mistake. And your job is to fix it. Also, I believe it's good to make mistakes and learn from them. But, you can't make all the mistakes. So, answering a question also gives you a way to understand the kind of mistakes that one could make and helps you to avoid making them in your day-to-day work. I think that is extremely powerful and smart,

> ...learn from others' mistakes...

In retrospect, I wasn't good at JavaScript at all. JavaScript `this` pissed me off so much and asynchronous was only one of the hardest spelling in my dictionary! Heck, I didn't even know how to put a breakpoint in DevTools! üòÜ Answering questions on SO about these topics was something that helped me gain an understanding of these topics and cause lesser bugs related to them at work.

## There's more than one solution

If there's one thing that answering on SO will teach you over time, is that there are multiple solutions to a problem. And, it's OK that you couldn't think of something better. You solved the problem, and "**it works**"‚Ñ¢.

This fact is quite humbling as well. You thought you knew everything about the subject you're answering about, and then comes a person who answers in a way that you couldn't/didn't think of. Soak it in, learn and continue.

## Gamification works ‚öΩÔ∏è

Almost everything you do on SO, be it asking questions, answering questions, editing badly formatted code, flagging spam, reviewing things etc. ends up giving you something that'll show on your profile. Reputation points and badges gamify this process and give you some dopamine to crunch on. Imagine a dopamine rich process which has gains for the producer, consumer and the mediator! Such awesome. Much wow. üíç
